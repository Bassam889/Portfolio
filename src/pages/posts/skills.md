My name is Leonardo Castillo and I enjoy creating software technologies. From very early on I got interested
about computer science at the age of 13 years old, was really into hardware but then I got into programming at the age 15. I tried many different areas like low level engineering, video game development, but then I found out web development, I fell in love by the fact of creating things that lives on the internet and people can see my work, since then I’ve never looked back at the decision I made choosing that area.

I’m very curious to explore and try new things, love the process for the things I do, grind myself in order to achieve my goals, I love connecting and working with other people I’m a big team player.

The big things I love about life are the fact that each circumstance is an opportunity to show my true potential and that I will never know everything, there’s always something new to experience, I can never get bored out of life.
